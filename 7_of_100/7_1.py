# Hangman logic

# Choose the word = chosen_word
# Draw the tree as a list of lists
# Draw the _ _ same as length of chosen_word)
# take input from user a letter
# if letter is in the chosen_word
#   then show the all matched letters in the _ _ _ _ var of word
# if letter is not in the chosen_word
#   then draw a piece of hangman up to 6 tries
# and while 6 tries is not end
#   then ask user to input the letter
#       else game over
